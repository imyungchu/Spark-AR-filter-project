## :memo: Step-by-step tutorial

### Step 1: Figure out what motivated you and what kind of filter you want to make (most importantly)

#### NCTU :arrow_right: NYCU

As for me, the reason of doing the project and what motivated me to do is as follows: At the beginning of 2021,**a lot of people waiting in a really long line just to take a shot of the background of National Chiao Tung University(NCTU)**. Since NCTU were about to change to National Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univerty(NYCU), I suposed a **filter is a great memento for NCTU and can virtually solve the lining up problem, making everyone to get a photo with NCTU anytime,anywhere.**

### Step 2: Download and change the set in ![](https://i.imgur.com/xFmqU6L.png) Spark AR Studio
#### The first step in IG filter production : Download Spark AR Studio
The first step is to download Spark AR Studio, a free software developed by Facebook, which specializes in making Fb and Instagram AR special effects, which can produce 2D or 3D effects. After downloading, you need to log in to Facebook before you can start using it.

#### Useable programs for material design

Spark AR Studio is a software that synthesizes materials into filters. If you need specified materials and pictures, you need to prepare materials before using Spark AR Studio. Material design still needs to use design programs, such as Adobe illustrator (Ai), Photoshop, Lightroom, etc.



### Step 3: Upload your file to Spark AR Hub and wait for their review (Try again if you not passed the examination by Meta)

#### IG Filter Review Guidelines

I have failed to publish in the first day.But successed in the second trial without changing the filter file.

The process of making IG filters is actually very fast. If you have experience, it can be completed within 1 hour, but if you are most afraid that you fail to pass the review criteria, it is equivalent to doing it for nothing. What are the criteria for the review of Spark AR Studio? When the review is rejected, the official analysis of the reasons for rejection and the display of the policy number will be received. The following are all common reasons for failing to pass the review: large filter files, fixed text filters, content infringement of intellectual copyright, illegal content, duplicate filter names with the same account, etc.
